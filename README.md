# PsychoAcousticsToolbox
by Keunwoo Choi (keunwoo.choi@qmul.ac.uk)
pat, PsychoAcousticsToolbox for python, is my new project for a convenient computation of loudness given time-frequency representation. Basically, the goal is to bridge between psychoacoustics (based on sound) and signal processing (based on signal/data).

Further functionality would be computing masking curve. At some moment I'll wrap it into a form of python package to make it easier to install and manage.

Please feel free to suggest me further upgrade!
